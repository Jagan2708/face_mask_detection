# Face Mask Detection 

This project is a machine learning-based face mask detection system. The goal is to identify whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask or not. The system utilizes machine learning techniques to achieve accurate and real-time detection.


## Installation

Clone my repository using the command

```bash
https://github.com/kitten04/Face-Mask-Detection.git
```
Or download the zip file and run the project on your system.
## Deployment

To deploy this project run - cd <file_path_to_this_repo>

```bash
cd Face-Mask-Detection
```
Create a virtual environment and activate it for the installation of the packages
```bash
python -m venv .env
```
Next
```bash
.env/Scripts/activate
```
Install the required packaes
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Upgrade the pip to the latest version
```bash
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
On the file train_mask_detector.py change the directory name with the respective dataset file path in your system.

Run the commands:
```bash
python train_mask_detector.py
```
Let the model train, it takes time to train. Then for real time face mask detection use the command: 
```bash
python detect_mask_video.py
```


## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing in different aspects of face mask detection.
## Results
The face mask detection system has been tested on various images and real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in accurately identifying whether individuals are wearing face masks on realtime with the camera.
